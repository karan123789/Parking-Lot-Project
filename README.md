# Parking-Lot-Project




This Parking Lot project is a Python-based system leveraging OpenCV to efficiently discern available parking spaces. Using computer vision techniques, the program detects vacant and occupied spots within a parking lot. Open spaces are highlighted with green lines, while occupied spaces are marked with red lines, providing a visual indication of their status. Additionally, the system counts the number of free spaces available, displaying this information to users. By combining image processing capabilities with color-based recognition, the project optimizes parking lot management, aiding drivers in quickly identifying available parking spots.
